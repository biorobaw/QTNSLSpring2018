# QTNSLSpring2018
This project contains 2 projects NSL and QTNSL.
To compile them open the .pro file inside of the resspective folder with qt creator.
Configure the project to use mingw as the compiler.
Add an extra "Make" build step with make argument "install".

TODO:
Currently QTNSL uses NSL but instead of including the project, a duplicate was created.
At some point the code diverged, so either a decision to integrate versions or keep only one is required.
