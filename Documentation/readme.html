<pre>NSL 3.0 Project Updates as of 7/15/2017
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Console NSL Project

	a. Source code changes since the previous version
	+=========================================================================+
	
	The MaxSelector model has been added and packaged with the source code.

	b. Notes on macros and comments
	+=========================================================================+

	Comments with the tag -bn7 or TODO: are the latest comments in the source code.
	In the RTS folder, asl_debug should be set to 0 to remove ASL debug output.

	c. Changes to data structures in specific
	+=========================================================================+

	Typedefs to nsl_num_&lt;number&gt; classes were removed. Class typedefs for vector data<br />	structures refer to nsl_num_&lt;name&gt;. In specific:

	typedef nsl_num_data nsl_data;<br />	typedef nsl_num_vector nsl_vector;<br />	typedef nsl_num_matrix nsl_matrix;

	In addition, nsl_num_&lt;number&gt; classes are no longer template types.

	nsl_num_&lt;name&gt; types were given math and access operators which are defined
	in their respective headers.

	d. Changes to functions in specific
	+=========================================================================+

	NSL math library functions were extended in certain cases. Specifically,
	nsl_num_library.C contains additional math functions for nsl_num_&lt;name&gt; classes
	that were required by the compiler, such as:

	void NSLmult_equal(nsl_num_data&amp; out, nsl_num_data&amp; a, num_type&amp; b);

	The extended overloads are present from line 1326 to line 2552.

	e. Changes to files
	+=========================================================================+

	All the math functions for nsl_num_3 and nsl_num_4 were packaged into single
	source files as nsl_num_3_library.C and nsl_num_4_library.C

	Source files which refer to Tcl/Tk functions were removed.

	Includes are defined with an XML document defining the include paths. This
	is specifically for Eclipse IDE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Qt NSL Project

	a. Source code changes since the previous version
	+=========================================================================+

	In addition to the changes applied to the console version which are included
	in the Qt version...

	nsl_neuron was removed from the project.

	The Qt NSL project initializes through a Qt-defined application
	initialization. First the core Qt application is initialized, then
	NSL initializations are launched which proceed to initialize the
	Qt NSL interface in QtNSLCore.cpp. First Qt NSL Objects are
	created, then they are configured and their private resources
	are allocated, then they are displayed. The remainder of Qt NSL
	processes are handled within the XNSL system.

	Qt GUI controls have been added and integrated with the XNSL code for
	visualization. There are two distinct groups of QtNSL classes.
	Namely, Qt Controls (xlib_qt_controls) and XNSL Objects (xlib_qt_src).
	Qt Controls are the intermediate classes which connect the XNSL
	system to Qt. XNSL Objects are the classes which set up visualizations
	abstractly and prepare them to be drawn.

	XNSL Objects:
	<strong>xnsl_qt_frame </strong>- This class provides the information for a window frame
	whose features are relayed to a Qt Object for drawing.

	<strong>xnsl_qt_canvas - </strong>This class defines the area inside a window frame for
	visualization objects to draw onto.

	<strong>xnsl_qt_graph </strong>- This class provides visualization functionality for
	graph XNSL graph objects. It takes a Qt-defined pixel map and
	modifies it before returning it to the canvas in which it operates,
	which is displayed on a window frame area.

	Qt Controls:
	<strong>xlib_qt_control</strong> - This class is a custom Qt object from which all Qt Controls are
	derived. All Qt Controls have display and configuration methods.

	<strong>xlib_qt_interface </strong>- This class is the GUI console and panel that users will 
	interact with when sending commands and running models in NSL. It holds 
	a panel which contains buttons to be added with <strong>QPushButton *0AddButtonToPanel(...)
	</strong>and a console that relays input to the nsl_buffer currently processing input
	for NSL.

	<strong>xlib_qt_framecontrol </strong>- This class is holds the window frame information as a 
	QWidget object. Its configuration method sets up the window frame dimensions.
	<strong>void NewChildEvent(int, int)</strong> is a class-specific method which makes a blank
	area for a new child. All children visual objects are stacked onto each other
	vertically.

	<strong>xlib_qt_canvascontrol</strong> - This class sets up a region inside a window frame
	which child objects draw to. Typically there is one visualization per canvas.
	The configuration method will set the canvas dimensions and the object will
	add itself to its frame via parent pointer defined at conception.	

	b. Changes to functions in specific
	+=========================================================================+	

	nsl_cmd_buffer had a function added to it: nsl_cmd_buffer::qt_run(char *);
	This function directly executes a command as though the user were typing
	it into the console version. Therefore any NSL command can be executed
	using this command.

	nsl_interpreter had two functions added to it: nsl_interpreter::qt_run(char *)
	which relays a command to the nsl_cmd_buffer as an nsl_shell type. Additionally,
	nsl_interpreter::qt_step(char *) simulates user command execution and returns
	the command return value.
